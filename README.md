"For a greener tomorrow"

****
## What

The application that has been developed has the ability to do this for you. It is an ordinary shopping list in a way that you can add shopping lists
to your user account and add or delete groceries to your different lists. But the app is special in a way that you can oversee
how much carbon dioxide every grocery cost, how much your list costs and how much you have spent so far.


## Why
Citizens in the world today spend around 9 ton carbon dioxide every year per person and of that we spend 2 - 2,5 tons
carbon dioxide on food. The emissions around the world differentiates between countries but an average is around that number. 
This means that roughly between 21% - 31% comes from food.

The goal with this application is to make users more aware of how they are spending their CO2 when shopping for groceries,
and to make it easier to see exactly which groceries you are spending a lot of CO2 on.
It should be easy to create shopping lists, to add and remove groceries and to oversee the total spending throughout the time.
By implementing this application into peoples everyday life, hope is that the CO2 pollution will decrease partly
so that the climate goals will be reached.
